#  Library Management System

##  Project Description

The **Library Management System** is a relational database project designed to streamline and automate the core functions of a library. It helps manage book records, authors, publishers, member registrations, borrowing and returning transactions, and late return fines. The system is structured using SQL and follows best practices in database normalization and entity relationships.

---

##  Features

- Manage book inventory with available copies tracking
- Record and track member borrow/return history
- Maintain structured data for authors, publishers, and categories
- Calculate and store fines for overdue returns (optional feature)
- Easy expansion for digital library systems (e.g., QR/RFID integration)

---

## How to Set Up / Run the Project

### Prerequisites:
- SQL-compatible RDBMS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
- SQL client or interface (e.g., phpMyAdmin, DBeaver, MySQL Workbench)

### Steps:
1. Clone this repository or download the `.sql` file.
2. Open your SQL database client.
3. Create a new database (e.g., `library_db`).
4. Import or run the `library_schema.sql` file provided in this repo.
5. (Optional) Add seed data for testing.
